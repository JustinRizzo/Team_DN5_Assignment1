Project Progress & Individual Updates\n","Eric Molner demonstrated his progress on the regional operational analysis using Google Cloud Platform (GCP), BigQuery, and Looker Studio.\n","He aggregated Superstore data by various dimensions and calculated days to ship using the date_diff function.\n","Eric utilized Gemini for SQL generation, finding it helpful for navigating syntax differences from Microsoft Azure SQL.\n","He also explored BigQuery's data profiling and insights features, which helped identify performance metrics like the profit-to-sales ratio by region (highlighting South and Central as areas with lower ratios).\n","Eric presented a dashboard in Looker Studio visualizing these findings, including a geo-map showing profitable states and customer numbers, and an analysis of shipping times by region and class (noting longer times for second-class shipping in the Central region).\n","He offered to share his Looker Studio work with the team.\n","Justin Rizzo admitted limited progress due to work commitments and expressed some confusion about the project requirements.\n","Sharon Elise White confirmed she performed a data quality check on the Superstore data and found no significant issues, emphasizing that the assignment focuses more on data interpretation than deep data cleaning.\n","\n","2. Discussion on Deliverables & Collaboration\n","The team confirmed the project deadline is July 18th.\n","Sharon raised concerns about efficiently integrating individual findings for the \"cross-functional implications and conflicting findings\" section.\n","Christopher suggested creating a draft Word document where each member summarizes their key findings in a few bullet points to facilitate easier cross-referencing and identification of connections or conflicts.\n","The team agreed that each member should summarize their insights in 2-3 bullet points as soon as possible.\n","Google Drive was confirmed as the primary shared folder for all project materials.\n","Sharon offered to create the presentation layout and tighten up the executive summary by Tuesday, provided all individual contributions are uploaded.\n","The discussion touched upon GitHub repository and Colab (IPYNB files) submissions.\n","Justin and Eric expressed unfamiliarity with GitHub. Christopher volunteered to work on the GitHub repository.\n","Sharon mentioned the professor clarified in a recent announcement/meeting that GitHub and Colab are primarily for Assignment 2, and for Assignment 1, PDF submissions should suffice. Justin corroborated this, stating the professor said GitHub is for Lab 2 and Assignment 2. Eric suggested he will gather his content in a Word document and prompts/SQL code, and the team can package it later.\n","\n","3. Next Steps & Meeting Schedule\n","Team members will aim to provide a soft update by Sunday on their progress, uploading their materials and summarizations to the Google Drive.\n","A follow-up meeting is tentatively scheduled for Tuesday evening (around 6:00 PM Central Time) to review progress, identify remaining tasks, and ensure cohesive integration of individual analyses.\n","The final review of the consolidated project is targeted for Thursday morning, with submission on Friday.\n","Sharon will confirm the precise time for the Tuesday meeting.\n","\n","4. Other Discussions\n","Quiz 1 has been postponed to Monday evening due to Brightspace issues. The team discussed using Gemini (or other AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude) for assistance, noting Gemini's detailed responses compared to Copilot.\n","\n","5. Action Items\n","All: Summarize individual analysis insights in 2-3 bullet points and upload to the shared Google Drive by Sunday.\n","Eric Molner: Share Looker Studio work with the team via email.\n","Christopher Allen Fischer: Work on the GitHub repository.\n","Sharon Elise White: Create the presentation layout and draft the executive summary by Tuesday.\n","Sharon Elise White: Confirm the exact time for the Tuesday meeting."],"metadata":{"id":"oWTrP_0i1ANR"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Assignment 1 Touchpoint 2"],"metadata":{"id":"sCaY2gVp1HM9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The discussion focused on organizing documents and preparing for a three-minute video presentation. Sharon Elise White emphasized the importance of labeling documents to facilitate the creation of a draft executive summary and proposed using her AI presentation tool to develop a template. She identified excessive discounts in her findings, which she plans to visualize in Tableau.\n","Eric Molner confirmed that the presentation slides would be in PowerPoint format and raised concerns about the feasibility of having four speakers within the time constraints, suggesting that one person might present. The team agreed to clarify presentation requirements with their professor and acknowledged the need for a cohesive narrative that connects problems with solutions.\n","Collaboration on a five-slide presentation was initiated, covering a problem statement, key findings, integrated insights, and top recommendations. Christopher Allen Fischer reported challenges with errors in his file that were affecting his progress, while Eric Molner and Sharon offered assistance. The team also discussed the status of their GitHub repository, with Justin Rizzo recalling that it might not be necessary for their assignment.\n","They confirmed office hours for further inquiries and shared insights on using tools like BigQuery and Looker Studio for analysis. Plans were made for completing the executive summary and strategic recommendations, with Sharon aiming to have a draft ready for review the following day. The group agreed to maintain communication and collaborate to meet their Friday deadline.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"r0m5NdTL1J0G"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["7/17/2025 Meeting Minutes"],"metadata":{"id":"Q5PO5U6x1L5d"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Summary:\n","\n","The discussion centered on project deadlines, tools for data analysis, and the organization of an upcoming presentation. Christopher expressed confusion about the assignment due date, which was confirmed to be extended to Sunday. Eric provided a demonstration on using Jupyter notebooks to connect to BigQuery and upload data, while Sharon shared her experience with AI tools like Gemini for generating prompts. The team acknowledged the learning curve associated with these new methodologies and discussed the need for alignment on their integrated analysis and executive summary.\n","\n","Sharon indicated that she had completed her tasks but needed to finalize edits on the presentation, prompting Eric to suggest extending the deadline. The group discussed scheduling a recording session and coordinating their availability. Sharon offered to assist with document formatting to ensure consistency, and they agreed to work together to facilitate the recording and editing process. Eric initiated a conversation about creating a cohesive prompt log, with Sharon detailing how to export prompts from Colab to Excel, while Christopher mentioned his use of BigQuery for querying prompts.\n","\n","The team explored the importance of context in AI data analysis to avoid hallucination, with Justin explaining his workflow and Sharon discussing her method of processing queries. Eric sought clarity on deliverables related to prompts and results, emphasizing the need for comprehensive documentation. Christopher inquired about the required number of visuals for their project, which Eric confirmed as a minimum of three. They discussed compiling all visualizations into a single file and considered submission formats, including PDF and Markdown.\n","\n","As the meeting progressed, the team focused on organizing their presentation and allocating speaking roles. Sharon raised concerns about the time frame, while Justin suggested that each member cover their own slide. Eric volunteered to manage the introduction and conclusion, and they aimed for a total speaking time of around two minutes and fifty seconds.\n","\n","The group also collaborated on crafting an executive summary, discussing formatting and strategies for conciseness.
